### Postdoctoral Position in High-Latitude Climate Dynamics at the University of Victoria

We are seeking an engaged, enthusiastic individual for a postdoctoral research position investigating the dynamics of high-latitude climates.  The researcher will explore the workings of Arctic and Antarctic climate broadly, and may consider any (or all, time permitting) of the following scientific directions in high-latitude climate change:  (1) the impact of dynamic atmospheric processes during the shoulder seasons (fall and spring) on the onset of sea ice growth and melt; (2) the role of atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamic processes in amplifying polar climate change in winter; and (3) the impact of atmospheric moisture transport, and cloud feedback processes, in polar climate change through the seasons.  Other research directions on the dynamics of polar climate change are also possible.  

The researcher will use output from state-of-the-art global climate models, reanalyses, and satellite/ground observations in her/his work, and may also run global climate model experiments.  The researcher will publish manuscripts in high-quality peer-reviewed journals, and present findings at national and international scientific conferences.  The position is supported as a collaboration between the Climate Lab in the [School of Earth and Ocean Sciences](https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/) at the University of Victoria, and the [HiLAT project](https://www.hilat.org), funded by the US Department of Energy Office of Science.

The researcher will sit at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria on beautiful Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and will have the opportunity to collaborate locally with scientists at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCMa), and remotely with scientists at the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division.  Funding is available for two years, with a possibility of extension to a third year.    

**Minimum Qualifications:**
* PhD in Atmospheric Sciences, Physical Oceanography, Applied Mathematics, or a related field.
* Experience in analyzing large climate datasets, using Python, R, NCL, or another data analysis language of choice.
* Understanding of coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics in the extratropics.
* Interest in polar climates and their sensitivity.

**Preferred Qualifications:**
* Experience running global climate models on parallel architectures.
* Familiarity with the physics of sea ice.
* Working knowledge of Fortran.  

Please contact Hansi Singh (hansingh@uvic.ca) and Philip Rasch (philip.rasch@pnnl.gov) with questions.  

***Interested applicants should submit a cover letter, up-to-date CV, and contact information for three professional references to Hansi Singh (hansingh@uvic.ca) by September 30, 2019.***
