Wilton is a physical oceanographer and a Ph.D. candidate in the Oceanographic Institute of the Federal University of the Rio Grande (FURG-Brazil). Wilton's research is focused on past and future changes in the large-scale ocean circulation and its effect on climate, with particular focus on the following topics: polar climate, past and future ocean overturning, paleoclimate, and the carbon cycle. Wilton is also passionate about landscape photographs, and you can check out his cool photos of Antarctica and Yellowstone National Park on his webpage:  https://willaguiar.github.io//

### Prof. Hansi Singh, PI

Hansi grew up in California and Texas, and is certainly a child of the '90s.  It is unclear why she has an unhealthy fascination with high latitude climates, as she generally avoids snow and ice.  When not indulging in polar science or spending time with her children, she pumps iron in her garage gym.
