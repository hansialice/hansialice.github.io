### Prof. Hansi Singh, PI

Hansi grew up in California and Texas, and is certainly a child of the '90s.  It is unclear why she has an unhealthy fascination with high latitude climates, as she generally avoids snow and ice.  When not indulging in polar science or spending time with her children, she pumps iron in her garage gym.
